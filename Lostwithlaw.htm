<div id="Legal Steps and Rights" class="tabcontent">
 <h2>Legal Steps and Rights</h2>
<p>This section will include the steps in a legal proceeding and the rights that victims are entitled to throughout the process.These are the legal steps that most criminal courts follow. This list is not exhaustive and there may be more steps that a certain court follows. </p>
<ol>
  <li>Judge or Jury- The Constitution gives everyone the right to a trial by jury in all cases except for "petty" cases, where the defendant cannot be imprisioned for more than 6 months. All other cases, felonies and serious misdemeanors, are entitled to jury trials. Defendants have the option to request to not have a trial by jury.</li>
  <li>Jury Selection Process- Potenetial jurors answer questions, about their backgrounds and attitudes. Some questions jurors are asked are routine, and others are case-specific.</li>
  <li>Evidence Issues- The judge rules on the admissibility of evidence before a party tries to introduce it in front of the jury.</li>
  <li>Opening Statements- An opening statement is an opportunity for the defense and the prosecution to describe what they will try to prove and what evidence they plan on offering. The prosecution makes their opening statement first and the defense usually makes their opening statement right after the prosecution, and they have the option to do it after the prosecution's case-in-chief. In most cases, it immediately follows the prosecutions opening statement.</li>
  <li>Prosecution's Case-in-Chief- The prosecution must convince the jury or judge, sometimes both, that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. They must satisfy the burden of guilt. The defendant is innocent until proven guilty.</li>
  <li>Direct Examination of Witnesses-</li>
  <li>Cross Examination- A cross-examination- after a witness has been called by the prosecution or defense and given testimony under direct examination, the other side has an opportunity to question the testimony. Most trial attorneys agree that cross examination is one of the most important tools for getting the truth. The prosecutor's goal is to undermine the credibiity of the testimony given by the defendant and other defense witnesses during direct examination.</li>
  <li>Defense Motion to Dismiss- The defense can ask the judge to dismiss the charges in the middle of the trial. The defense can ask the judge if the prosecution's case is strong enough to support a guilty verdict by making a Motion to Dismiss at the end of the prosecutions case-in-chief. If the motion is granted, the defense does not have to present their case and it is the legal equivalent of an acquittal, where the defendant cannot be tried again.</li>
  <li>Defendant's Case-in-Chief- This is when the defense presents their case. The defense can call their witnesses in whichever order they wish, following the same procedure as the prosecution's case-in-chief.</li>
  <li>Closing Argument- This argument is limited to the evidence presented in the trial. The prosecution asks for a verdict of guilty and the defense asks for a verdict of not guilty. The points adressed are, why the defendant should be found guilty or not guilty, a summary of evidence presented in the trial, and attack on the other sides case.</li>
  <li>Instructing the Jury- The jury learns the legal principles it will need to render its verdict, and where these principles. Prosecutors and defense attorneys submit proposed instructions to judges, who decide which instructions to give. In many cases, instructions are routine and drawn from a book of approved jury instructions.</li>
  <li>Jury Deliberation and Verdict- This is where the jury deliberates and comes to a verdict based on the evidence heard. If the jury cannot come to a unanimous verdict, there is a hung jury, and the defedant will be given a new trial with a new jury. If the jury reaches a decision, it is submitted to the court and presented to the defendant. If the defendant is given a guilty verdict and they believe they were not given a fair trial/want to get a different verdict, they can appeal it to the next highest court.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are rights that surviors are entitled to throughout the legal process. These are crime victim and witness rights, meaning there must be charges against the individual the person is seeking protection from in order to recieve these rights.

<div id="Perspectives and Explanations" class="tabcontent">
<h2>Perspectives and Explanations</h2>
<p>These are differing perspectives and explanations of human trafficking. No one defenition or explanation will work for everyone.</p>
<h4>Perspectives</h4>
<p>Just like any other topic, perspectives of human trafficking differ from person to person, but there is a consesus that human trafficking is immoral and wrong. Different people view human trafficking differently, and it is dependent on their background and current situation.</p>
<h4>Young Adult</h4>
<p>I think that human trafficking is not only immoral, which is why there are laws in place to make it illegal, but also one of the worst crimes that can be committed against someone. When a person is trafficked, their whole life is negatively impacted. Their loved one's lives are also changed in difficult ways. Human trafficking strips a human being of their rights legally given to them as a human being and in the United States Constitution. If an individual is lucky enough to become a survivor, their life will be forever damaged because of the inhumane treatment from the trafficker.</p>
<h4>Teacher</h4>
<p>"Human trafficking is disgusting and horrifying.  As a teacher and mother, it both terrifies and saddens me to think this is happening to unsuspecting and innocent children."</p>
<h4>Law Enforcement</h4>"I view law enforcement as a multifaceted, complex criminal enterprise that is, at it's core, deeply predatory. Human trafficking can take different forms, for instance labor trafficking involves the exploitation of workers to in essence engage in modern day endentured servitude; whereas, commercial sex trafficking exploits victims to perform sex acts against their will. Human trafficking is deeply impactful both on the individual victim's level, and across society as a whole."
<h4>Explanations</h4>
<p>These are different explanations of human trafficking. The general understanding of human trafficking is the same, but these are different ways to explain the crime.</p>
<li>From Merriam-Webster: organized criminal activity in which human beings are treated as possessions to be controlled and exploited (as by being forced into prostitution or involuntary labor).</li>
<li>From the U.S. Department of Justice- Human trafficking, also know as trafficking in persons, is a crime that involves compelling or coercing a person to provide labor or services, or to engage in commercial sex acts. The coercion can be subtle or overt, psychial or psychological.</li>
<li>From the Virginia Department of Criminal Justice Services- Human trafficking is a criminal activity in which people profit from the control and exploitation of others. Two forms of human trafficking are sex trafficking and labor trafficking. Human trafficking can occur anywhere, within and across U.S. borders, victimizing both U.S. citizens and non-citizens, both children and adults, and across all gender identities.</li>
<li>Additional explanation from the U.S. Department of Justice- Human trafficking is a crime involving the exploitation of a person for labor, services, or commercial sex.</li>
<p>Human trafficking is a violent crime that alters lives forever. Lost With Law is a resource for Williamsburg survivors. </p>
